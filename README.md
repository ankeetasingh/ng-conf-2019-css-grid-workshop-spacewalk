# Angular and CSS Grid: Get ready to fall in love: Spacewalk

Bill Odom

Yeah, thatâ€™s what I thought. ðŸ™‚ Itâ€™s not unreasonable â€” CSS can seem more like a hindrance than a help, an obstacle to be overcome instead of a tool that enables developers to create great applications.

Itâ€™s time to take another look. A lot of fantastic things have happened with CSS recently, and arguably the most significant of these is the widespread rollout of CSS Grid. Itâ€™s a whole new way to handle layout for web applications, and finally frees us from the misery of floats and the ratâ€™s nest of row/column divs that have infested our HTML templates for far too long.

Perhaps even more importantly, CSS Grid enables us to do things that, until now, were practically impossible (or just ridiculously painful) with HTML and CSS, and all with beautifully clean markup and straightforward, understandable CSS.

In this workshop, weâ€™ll take a lightning tour of CSS Grid and and see how it can make building Angular applications dramatically easier. Along the way, weâ€™ll touch on several other CSS capabilities (some recent, and some just tragically underappreciated), show how to use them in combination with Angular and CSS Grid, and demonstrate the amazing capabilities that these combinations unlock.

Angular is fantastic, CSS Grid is fantastic, and the two together? Unbeatable. Really, youâ€™re gonna love it. ðŸ™‚
